              The Daily Bin is a personal news aggregator that curates discussions from Hacker News using AI. Instead of
              summarizing the original articles, it focuses on the valuable insights and perspectives shared in the
              community discussions.
            </p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>

            <p>Every day, The Daily Bin fetches the top posts from Hacker News and uses AI to:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Filter the most interesting discussions based on engagement and content</li>
              <li>Summarize the discussions in a newspaper style</li>
              <li>Generate visual prompts for images that represent the content</li>
              <li>Present everything in an easy-to-read format</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              The goal is to provide a curated digest of the most insightful discussions happening in the tech
              community, saving you time while keeping you informed.
            </p>

              This project was inspired by the concept of "git scrapers" popularized by Simon Willison. It uses the
              Hacker News API provided by Y Combinator and the Algolia API.

            <p>
              All summaries are generated by AI and should be treated as interpretations rather than direct quotes.
              Links to the original discussions and articles are always provided.
